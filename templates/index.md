## Welcome to the Crystal Word Chain family of games

### Our Mission

Crystal Games is an open artifacts project with the mission of creating games that help you strengthen your Personal Universe and strengthen your relationships while also being fun.

### A Bit About Us

I built the board for the original [Crystal Word Chain](/project/crystal-word-chain) game over 25 years ago. That was long before I thought about what a Personal Universe or an Open Artifact was. Over the years, I wondered if there was some way that I could share my idea with others. I also wondered if my little word game could be be re-imagined as a more useful tool for personal growth. The result is this website.

If you're curious about what I mean by Personal Universe and Open Artifact, I recommend you visit the {% externalLink "Evolve the World", "https://evolvetheworld.org" %} website (also one of my projects) to learn more.
