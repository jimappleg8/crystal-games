- title: "Phase 1: The Foundation"
  status: "In Progress"
  vision: |
    We need to establish the core infrastructure. The goal is to make it easy for 
    anyone to clone the starter and get running in under 5 minutes.
  tasks:
    - "Set up Eleventy base configuration"
    - "Create the JSON generation pipeline"
    - "Design the landing page hero section"

- title: "Phase 2: The Network"
  status: "Planned"
  vision: |
    Once the single-site experience is solid, we need to connect it to the 
    Open Artifacts Hub. This involves finalizing the schema.
  tasks:
    - "Draft the JSON schema for Open Artifacts"
    - "Build the search indexer"
