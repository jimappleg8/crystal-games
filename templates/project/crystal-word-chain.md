I designed this game years ago with a friend of mine (thank you Emily!). Back in the day, I made a bunch of physical copies of it and gave them to friends and family. I decided it was time I made it into a free printable game and make it available to everyone. I did a little searching online and found that there are other games that people call "Word Chain" where you create a chain of words by starting the next link of the chain using the last letter of the previous word (e.g. time > egg > game, etc.). This game is different, so I hope I don't cause any confusion.

This game connects words using common two-word phrases or compound words (e.g. tea > tea time > time machine > machine learning, etc.). Also, it uses a grid system into which the words are placed, and that appears to be a unique approach.

## The Full-Size Version

This is the original large version of the game board that is intended to be played on a table. When I built these for friends a few years ago, I printed the board out in "tiles", taped and glued it together, then took it to a nearby office supply company that offered laminating. I designed the board to be just small enough to fit in that laminating machine, so your results might vary.

Once it's laminated, you can use wet-erase markers to write the words and then clean it off for the next game.

## A Smaller Version

Since then, I have designed a smaller version that is more easily printed out each time you want to play. If you have a printer that can print an 11 x 17 piece of paper, you can print it in one go. Otherwise, you will need to print just two 8.5 x 11 pages and tape them together.

No need to laminate it, you can play the game using regular pencils, pens or markers and print a new one next time you want to play.

Another thing that is different in the smaller version is that it includes an "Official Scorecard" so you can track points as you play. The idea is that, regardless of how many players you have, you end the game after 36 words are played. This also helps ensure that the game doesn't go on forever.

Both versions are [available as PDFs to download and print](/project/cwc-downloads/).
