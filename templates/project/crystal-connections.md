# Crystal Connections

The Crystal Connection version of this game is featured in my book *Don’t Save The World* as a way to strengthen your personal universe by helping you integrate your knowledge. 

Words represent ideas, and in this version of the game, you try to make interesting connections between ideas as conveyed by words. The more interesting the connection, the better. It's inspired, in part, by the Glass Beads Game from Hermann Hesse's novel of the same name. Apparently in that novel (I admit I have not read it) he doesn't really explain how the game is played, so we can feel free to make up our own rules.

It's a happy connection that one meaning for "crystal" is a high-quality form of glass. I've resisted calling the game "Crystal Beads", though I can't really say why. I may be missing a great opportunity.

Crystal Word Chain can be played as a form of Connections Game. We’re already making connection between individual words, so in a way, we’re just extending the original idea. 

The kinds of connections are more complex, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some examples. 

- Light
	- Radio - they’re both electromagnetic waves. 
	- Feather - the common English simile “light as a feather”. 
	- Up - concepts that are meaningless in the weightlessness of space (light as in not heavy). 
	- If there were two words like “knowledge” and “reason” they are tenets of the enlightenment. 
	- Words that would work for the original game could work, but it’s harder to make an argument for the connection, e.g. beer (as in light beer) or light switch. There is a connection but it’s more about language than reality. The same is true for rhyming words like night light. 

#### Seed words

I think we will want to have different seed words, but I’m not sure about that. The ones for the main version of the game might be simple enough that they work just fine.
