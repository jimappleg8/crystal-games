The Crystal Connection version of this game is featured in my book *Don’t Save The World*. I designed it as a fun way for you and your friends to interconnect the many siloed ideas you hold in your mind. 

Because the goal is to interconnect ideas already in your mind, it is a very personal game and there are no wrong answers. You may be tempted to fact-check connections during the game (is a mushroom technically a plant?) but the goal of the game is not accuracy. Truth has many dimensions and a connection that may seem intellectually incorrect may still be emotionally or spiritually true for the player. 

By actively making these connections, you’ll strengthen them, making your personal universe more integrated and flexible. By playing this game with others, you can also learn from the surprising connections they make. 

## Wordplay and Connections

Crystal Connection’s sister game, Crystal Word Chain, is based on wordplay which is specific to the languages we speak. Puns, homophones and common word pairs all exist at a level of language that is largely separate from the meanings that language represents. 

Language evolved out of the human desire to communicate our experience to others. Crystal Connections is about using language (words) to interconnect our personal experiences and the meanings we give them.

The connections you make during the game will likely come to you as emotions, images, somatic (body) responses or even sounds or smells. Part of the challenge of the game is to express those experiences in words. I encourage you to pause and let the word come to you. Try not to overthink it. You can always reflect on it later when the game is over. 

## The Glass Beads Game

The game is inspired, in part, by the Glass Beads Game from Hermann Hesse's novel of the same name. Apparently in that novel (I admit I have not read it) he doesn't really explain how the game is played, so we can feel free to make up our own rules. 

It's a happy connection that one meaning for "crystal" is a high-quality form of glass, but I've resisted calling the game "Crystal Beads." I think that the object of Crystal Connections is different. I think that the Glass Beads Game is more an academic competition as Hesse envisioned it, not an opportunity for self-reflection or personal growth.

Crystal Word Chain can be played as a form of Connections Game. We’re already making connection between individual words, so in a way, we’re just extending the original idea. 

The kinds of connections are more complex, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Here are some examples. 

- Light
	- Radio - they’re both electromagnetic waves. 
	- Feather - the common English simile “light as a feather”. 
	- Up - concepts that are meaningless in the weightlessness of space (light as in not heavy). 
	- If there were two words like “knowledge” and “reason” they are tenets of the enlightenment. 
	- Words that would work for the original game could work, but it’s harder to make an argument for the connection, e.g. beer (as in light beer) or light switch. There is a connection but it’s more about language than reality. The same is true for rhyming words like night light. 

#### Seed words

I think we will want to have different seed words, but I’m not sure about that. The ones for the main version of the game might be simple enough that they work just fine. 

## Goals

The game is not really about gaining new knowledge unless it’s knowledge about ourselves. We don’t need to do fact checking because it’s all about our internal model of Universe, not provable facts. 

It’s really about integration and flexibility of thinking. Not so much comprehensiveness or accuracy. 

## Categories

- Field of Knowledge (What You Think You Know): Add a concept related to a specific domain (science, linguistics, etc.)
- Perspective Shift: Look at an idea metaphorically, symbolically, or from a new angle.

- Emotional Resonance: Connect the concept to feelings, the body, or values.
- Cultural Mirror: How is this reflected in art, media, and society?
