### Object of the Game

The object of the game is to fill in the blanks on the board with concepts (as represented by single words) according to the rules. Some of the blanks are more difficult than others and more difficult blanks are worth more points. The player with the most points at the end of the game could be declared "the winner," but really, this game is meant to be collaborative, so it's OK if you don't keep track.

### Playing the Game

This goal of the game is to have fun and be as creative as possible. Use the rules to keep chaos from setting in, but remember that creativity counts for as much as following the rules exactly.

1. Start by choosing an initial concept (a seed) for the center of the crystal. If you want to roll a die to see who takes the first turn, feel free.

2. A turn looks like this: the player chooses a word on the board and asks themselves "what comes up for me in connection to this word?" That connection can simple or profound; it doesn't matter which it is. For example, let's say the word on the board is "**tea**". One player might choose the word "**comfort**" explaining that *my Grandmother always drank tea before bed to help her sleep*. Another player might have chosen the word "**taxes**" explaining that *to citizens of the American colonies, the high price of tea represented the unfair taxation being imposed by Britain*. Other player might have thought of "**herbal**" or "**ritual**". In a very real sense there are no wrong answers. Discussion among the players is encouraged. 

3. The player then adds their word to the board. Each new word added to the crystal is placed in an adjacent oval, triangular or circular space, and only one space can be filled in per turn.
